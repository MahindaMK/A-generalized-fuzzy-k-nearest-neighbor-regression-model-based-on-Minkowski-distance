# A generalized fuzzy k-nearest neighbor regression model based on Minkowski distance

## Introduction
#### The Md-FKNNreg is a generalized regression model based on the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) rule. The FKNN algorithm, one of the most well-known and effective supervised learning techniques, has often been used in data classification problems but rarely in regression settings. Using the Minkowski distance allows the Md-FKNNreg method to obtain more reasonable nearest neighbors to the target sample. Another key advantage of this method is that the nearest neighbors are weighted by fuzzy weights based on their similarity to the target sample, leading to the most accurate prediction through a weighted average.
